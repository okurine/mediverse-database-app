# MediVerse

MediVerse is a data-driven healthcare intelligence platform that brings together clinical, operational, and patient-generated data into one cohesive system. It provides a secure, AI-powered environment where hospitals, researchers, clinicians, patients, and administrators can collaborate, analyze, and make decisions without unnecessary complexity. By simplifying data access, preparation, and visualization, MediVerse enables smarter, real-time decision-making.

This repository includes a Docker Compose setup for:

- **MySQL Database** — automatically runs all SQL initialization scripts from the `database-files/` directory.
- **Backend API (Flask REST API)** — handles all server-side logic and database interactions.
- **Frontend UI (Streamlit)** — provides the user-facing interface for interacting with the system.
